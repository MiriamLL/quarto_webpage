I develop R packages that are useful for my work. I'm often working on new packages so stay tuned. <br>


## Package larus

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%" style="padding-left: 0; margin-left: 0;"}

This package focuses on GPS-GSM data, offering tools for data manipulation, trip identification, and calculation of trip parameters like duration, maximum distance, and path length. Additionally, it supports trip interpolation.

There are three key issues in determining the foraging trips in **GSMs** attached to **gulls**:
- Battery charge and gaps (intervals) in the data.
- Central locations might change, so foraging trips can be difficult to identify.
- The gulls just do whatever they want.

# GermanNorthSea

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here(),"/packages/2023-06-02-germannorthsea/GNS_front.png"))
```

The goal is provide easy access to shapefiles of the North Sea.
This package contains shapefiles from the **German North Sea**: <br>
Detailed information and uses: <https://github.com/MiriamLL/GermanNorthSea>

You can install the package GermanNorthSea from GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/GermanNorthSea")
```

For referencing, please use the original resources and links provided in the githubpage for the different shapefiles.

# seamonas

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here(),"/packages/2023-04-16-seamonas/seamonas_front.png"))
```

**seamonas** provides easy access to information based on guidelines for monitoring seabirds at sea. It includes detailed table content and a sample dataset to support implementation. Information based on the HELCOM Monitoring Guidelines for Seabirds at Sea [ESAS database](https://helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HELCOM-Monitoring-guidelines-for-seabirds-at-sea-monitoring.pdf).

Detailed information and uses: <https://github.com/MiriamLL/seamonas>

**seamonas** contains:

-   A **list of 549 species** across morphological separated groups.
-   Harmonized **column names** and guidance for completing each entry.
-   Unified **descriptions** for field entries, includes abiotic structures, activity codes, associations.
-   One **trip example** from a monitoring containing basic trip information.
-   One **survey example** from a monitoring containing survey information.
-   One survey example from a monitoring containing **species detected and specifications**.

You can install the development version of seamonas from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/seamonas")
```

# sula

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here(),"/packages/2021-05-14-sula/sula_front.png"))
```

**sula** contains:

-   **Data** from GPS collected from masked booby (*Sula dactylatra*) at Rapa Nui, Chile.
-   **Thirteen functions** to clean and calculate trip parameters from GPS data. 

Detailed information and uses: <https://github.com/MiriamLL/sula>

You can install the development version of sula from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/sula")
```

Created in 2020, updated in 2025, after replacing rgeos with sf.

# spheniscus

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here(),"/packages/2021-05-14-spheniscus/spheniscus_front.png"))
```

**spheniscus** containts:

- **Data** from TDR collected from Humboldt penguins (*Spheniscus humboldi*) at Tilgo Island, Chile.
- Functions to clean data and obtain diving parameters from TDR data. 

Detailed information and uses: <https://github.com/MiriamLL/spheniscus>

You can install the development version of spheniscus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/speniscus")
