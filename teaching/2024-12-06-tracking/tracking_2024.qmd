# Intro

There are numerous tools available for analyzing tracking data. In this post, I share a curated collection of my blog entries that focus specifically on movement analysis, covering from data loading and cleaning to visualizations. Additionally, I’ve included a brief list of papers that can serve as guidance when embarking on tracking studies.

## Load data
- [From movebank](https://miriamll.github.io/teaching_R/Tracking_0606.html#4)\
- [From csv](https://miriamll.github.io/teaching_R/Tracking_0606.html#20)

## Data preparation
- [Usage of time formats](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2022-06-30-time-formats/)\
- [Converting times](https://miriamll.github.io/teaching_R/Tracking_0606.html#36)\
- [Time overlap between individuals](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2022-02-24-timeoverlaps/)\
- [Locate the animals central location](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2022-07-01-nestlocation/)\
- [Include Julian days](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2022-08-17-count-days/)\
- [Identify Day or night](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2022-12-04-day-night/)\

- [Behaviour classification](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2021-11-25-embc/)

## Clean raw data
- [Select columns](https://miriamll.github.io/teaching_R/Tracking_0606.html#30)\
- [Remove undesired locations](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2024-08-01-removelocs/)\
- [Identify gaps](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2022-10-04-identify-gaps/)\
- [Complete or incomplete](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2024-11-05-completeorincomplete/)\
- [Export clean data frame](https://miriamll.github.io/teaching_R/Tracking_0606.html#34)

## Calculate trip parameters
- Number of trips: [Identify events](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2024-09-19-identifyevents/)\
- Maximum distance: [Distance from point](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2024-06-04-pointsdistance/)\
- Total length path: [Distance between points](https://www.miriam-lerma.com/posts/2024-10-08-distancepoints/)

## Home range tools and considerations

Note that technology is advancing rapidly, and some of the scripts rely on functions that might already being deprecated.

Even though there are a lot of resources out there, I prefer to write my own scripts, particularly when addressing specific questions. If you need help or a custom script, feel free to reach out to me.
